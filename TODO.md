🛠️ What's Next?
Here are a few awesome next-step ideas, just say the word:

✴️ Visual & Audio Feedback:
Glow or highlight ToyBox when an object is hovered for deletion

"Poof!" particle effect or sound when a toy is destroyed

✴️ UI / UX Improvements:
Add tooltips for each ToyBox button

Let user resize the ToyBoxPanel at runtime with mouse handles

Toggle to lock/unlock ToyBox dragging

✴️ More Toys!
Add soccer ball, football, baseball (already in your assets)

Use the same ToyProperties system with different physics

✴️ Save/Load Layouts
Save active toys in the scene

Load them back on launch or button press
